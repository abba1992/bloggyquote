                "Do your work. Not just your work and no more, but a little more for the lavishing's sake. That little more which is worth all the rest. And if you doubt as you must; and if you suffer as you must-- do your work. Put your heart into it and the sky will clear. And then out of your very doubt and suffering will be born the supreme joy of life." - Dean Briggs
